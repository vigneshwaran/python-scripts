## 6.1 Inheritance
####################################################

# Inheritance allows new child classes to be defined that inherit methods and
# variables from their parent class.

# Using the Human class defined above as the base or parent class, we can
# define a child class, Superhero, which inherits the class variables like
# "species", "name", and "age", as well as methods, like "sing" and "grunt"
# from the Human class, but can also have its own unique properties.

# To take advantage of modularization by file you could place the classes above in their own files,
# say, human.py

# To import functions from other files use the following format
# from "filename-without-extension" import "function-or-class"

from human import Human


# Specify the parent class(es) as parameters to the class definition
class Superhero(Human):

    # If the child class should inherit all of the parent's definitions without
    # any modifications, you can just use the "pass" keyword (and nothing else)
    # but in this case it is commented out to allow for a unique child class:
    # pass

    # Child classes can override their parents' attributes
    species = 'Superhuman'

    # Children automatically inherit their parent class's constructor including
    # its arguments, but can also define additional arguments or definitions
    # and override its methods such as the class constructor.
    # This constructor inherits the "name" argument from the "Human" class and
    # adds the "superpower" and "movie" arguments:
    def __init__(self, name, movie=False,
                 superpowers=["super strength", "bulletproofing"]):

        # add additional class attributes:
        self.fictional = True
        self.movie = movie
        self.superpowers = superpowers

        # The "super" function lets you access the parent class's methods
        # that are overridden by the child, in this case, the __init__ method.
        # This calls the parent class constructor:
        super().__init__(name)

    # overload the sing method
    def sing(self):
        return 'Dun, dun, DUN!'

    # add an additional class method
    def boast(self):
        for power in self.superpowers:
            print("I wield the power of {pow}!".format(pow=power))


if __name__ == '__main__':
    sup = Superhero(name="Tick")

    # Instance type checks
    if isinstance(sup, Human):
        print('I am human')
    if type(sup) is Superhero:
        print('I am a superhero')

    # Get the Method Resolution search Order used by both getattr() and super()
    # This attribute is dynamic and can be updated
    print(Superhero.__mro__)    # => (<class '__main__.Superhero'>,
                                # => <class 'human.Human'>, <class 'object'>)

    # Calls parent method but uses its own class attribute
    print(sup.get_species())    # => Superhuman

    # Calls overloaded method
    print(sup.sing())           # => Dun, dun, DUN!

    # Calls method from Human
    sup.say('Spoon')            # => Tick: Spoon

    # Call method that exists only in Superhero
    sup.boast()                 # => I wield the power of super strength!
                                # => I wield the power of bulletproofing!

    # Inherited class attribute
    sup.age = 31
    print(sup.age)              # => 31

    # Attribute that only exists within Superhero
